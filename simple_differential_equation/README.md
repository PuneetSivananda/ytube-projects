Bunny population model     

$$
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = {\lambda x}
$$

Where population of bunnies is x


What is the population as a function of time?
$$
    x(t)
$$
    

Method 1:
$$
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = {\lambda x}   
$$
$$
   \int\frac{\partial x}{x} = \int{\lambda}{\partial t}
$$
 
$$
    ln(x(t)) = \lambda t+ C
$$

$$
    x(t) = e^{\lambda t + C}
$$


$$
= e^{\lambda t}k
$$

- K = measurement of the population of bunnies
$$
x(0) = e^{0}k => k = x(0)
$$
- Therefore

$$
x(t) = e^{\lambda t}x(0)
$$



What is e(exponential)?
- First order linear ordinary differential equation
