Bunny population model     

$$
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = {\lambda x}
$$

Where population of bunnies is x


What is the population as a function of time?
$$
    x(t)
$$
    

Method 1:
$$
    \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = {\lambda x}   
$$
$$
   \int\frac{\partial x}{x} = \int{\lambda}{\partial t}
$$
 
$$
    ln(x(t))
$$
