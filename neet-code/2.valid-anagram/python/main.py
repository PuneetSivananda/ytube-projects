# Craete a Hashmap that stores each string, key: char, value: count
# Now compare the 2 Hashmaps of the 2 Strings

# method:
    # check the length of 2 string if same process
    # else
    #  return strings do not match
    # convert string1 and string2 to hashmaps
    # compare the same keys are present in both the hashmaps
    # for each k,v in string1 hashmap compare the values of 2nd hashmap
